Subject: Memo on policy paper conclusions and staff call



Rick:

Please find attached a short memo regarding last week's call with Jim and
the Enron RTO team. It also has some thoughts on what we might cover with
Steve K. at 2:00 p.m. CDT today.

Some other time I would like to have a quick chat about how we move to the
next step with the RTOs. It strikes me that there has been a real absence of
cleare-headed thinking in the stakeholder chin-wagging sessions. If FERC
will not impose a single design - on an abbreviated timeframe - is there
another way to add some economic logic into the equation?


Speak to you later...

had the typewriter on the original contract.   I quickly  looked in my 
TurboPark binders, but didn't immediately find the ABB contract.  

There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete 
Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.  It wasn't 
approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC 
post TurboPark.  I wasn't involved in the Fountain Valley transformer

		 Subject: Fountain Valley Transformer Contract - FT Pierce -no approvals yet

The Fort Pierce crowd is pressuring for a form of transforner contract.Of 
course it must be TurboPark compliant. Since we have just done a transformer 
agreement with ABB for Fountain valley and its all signed off on by ABB, 
TurboPark, Rose atal,  and the new project lenders, I would like to start 
with that form and ot reinvent the wheel.

The ABB form that is in the TurboPark closing binders has a footer that reads 
""WAS:83848.6"". I assume that either A&K or LLGM had the typewriter. Sheila or 
Roseann, I would appreciate it if one of you could get the firm that has the 
document on their computers to send it out, with the attachments, so Bart and 
the Ft Pierce team could get to work on it. We also have the hard copy 
override letter with ABB that make the TurboPark corrections, and we can 
either add these directly to the contract or leave it as an override letter. 

Mr. Lund, can you check at NEPCO and see if anyone there has electronics on 
this?

Next, for equipment that will be bought by Purchase Order instead of under a 
contract, we need the TurboPark bits that go into the PO, since we will be 
getting a lot of requests to issue PO's next. Roseann, could you send us what 
you have in mind forthe PO's, or should we just take the override letter, add 
it into the PO form, and let you see what we are doing?

Last, Jim Davis called to see where we are in the TurboPark cycle and if 
issuing a PO or Contract (ie., making a commitment) is ok at this point. Jim, 
thanks for making sure the loops are closed.  Bart gave me a voice mail that 
we do not have a DASH approval or other authorization. Therefore I ask at 
this point that Jim not issue any paper on the project until we get clearance 
from Bart and Roseann. 

Thanks

	While I agree with you that having you go to Houston would be productive, it is a luxury that we cannot afford. We are currently four and a half months behind on our actualization process, with both the internal and external customers running out of patience. With also have Brett leaving this Friday and Donna out until next week, I need you to focus solely on getting us actualized for the months in question. We also have a deliverable to Seattle City Light by the end of this week. Until we get these items settled, I can not allow the transition of duties between yourself and Virginia to take place as we had planned. We all want this transition to happen, but we have to get these deliverables out the door.  I hope that you can understand that with all of these issues on the VM plate, my answer will have to be no to your going to Houston.

Chris,

I understand that Virginia has been approached to head down to Houston and meet with the Settlements group.  I would like to be part of that as well, if that is alright.  There are still some things they do on their side that I would like to learn about, and I think that Virginia and I could collaborate on a sharing of information meeting and both would get a lot out of it.

Let me know.  I guess the date hasn't been settled, yet, but I am available pretty much any time in the next few weeks.

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

know

If you have questions, let me know


Receipt Point definition(s)


FOR POWER

The receipt point and delivery point definitions are identical as they apply 
to MDEA proper at the Entergy - MDEA interfaces.

The receipt point and delivery point definitions for EPMI and third-party 
transactions should be as defined in each individual deal/transaction 
Confirmation.

(IE, you have four power definitions)


FOR GAS

The receipt point for gas is defined in each individual deal Confirm where 
gas may be purchased, and then transported to MDEA.

There are 3 delivery points for gas:

for Clarksdale it is the interconnect between Texas Gas and Clarksdale

for Yazoo City you have (a) the interconnect between Southern Natural Gas 
(Sonat) and Mississippi Valley Gas for the Yazoo City Power Plant (Sonat 
Delivery Point)
                                   (b)  the interconnect between Mississippi 
Valley Gas (MVG) and the Yazoo City Power Plant (MVG Delivery Point)



Off Peak Definition

This is the same definition as the ON PEAK definition, except the off peak 
hours beginning and ending are the opposite of the on peak hours.


Transmission Services

Transmission Services means the analysis and/or procurement of transmission 
capacity as part of the Scheduling Services by EPMI as MDEA's Scheduling 
Entity.



Scheduling Equipment

Suggest either don't refer to a list at all, or you can say such equipment is 
included in the list of equipment on the Exhibit ?, but try to name the 
specific equipment.


Term

It is simply my preference to let the one year term evergreen automatically 
each year unless prior notice is given by either party.  I don't think anyone 
else has a particular preference, unless you do.  Don't know if MDEA has a 
preference on this.


Contracted Resources

Thought we had an Exhibit for this already called Off-System Contracted 
Resources, so I will get it to you separately in a few minutes.  We also have 
a blank Existing Transaction Exhibit.  I thought that we might blend the 
Contract resources and the Gas Transportation Agreements into the Existing 
Transaction Exhibit.

Hi guys, 

Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:

Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
exhibit to describe.  RR
Off peak defn - RR 
transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
suggestions?
scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
date, subject matter of contract.

More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.

WOW!!!  You do have some news.  Congratulations!  That's amazing how after all these years you marry a Port Neches girl...  Well, I certainly approve of your choice.  Renee was always such a nice and pretty girl and I'm sure that hasn't changed.  Please tell her how happy I am for the two of you.  Doesn't she have one son?  The last time we spoke you two were beginning to date and I believe you mentioned her son.  How long ago was that?  Too long...
 
Well, guess I'll update you on our family.  Chad is 13 yrs. old (boy, does that make me feel old!!!) and is very into sports.  He's a great kid most of the time but very strong willed.  The combination of strong will and the puberty stage could drive you crazy if you let it...Tom is still practicing international tax law and stays very busy.  He'd like to teach law school one day but that will probably have to wait until Chad finishes college. I am staying at home this year but went back to teaching part-time (high school level)  over the last couple of years.  Decided to take some real estate classes this year and work on my tennis game.  I also volunteer two days a week at his school.  We are living in Highland Park which is in Dallas but are moving to a suburb of Dallas called Southlake soon since our house has sold.  We'd like a bigger lot and Southlake is beautiful, located between Dallas & Fort Worth which is nice. I'll get you my new phone # in a few weeks.  
My family is all fine and the only detail I'll bore you with is that my brother, Cory, just married for the third time.  Third time's the charm, right???  We all hope so. Well, let me know more about your life when you have a change to write back.  How are your parents and siblings?  What type of work are you doing?  Where do you live in Houston?  Tell Renee hello and let me here from you...

Using my tuned hydraulic model (with updated friction factors using current SCADA) and the current efficiencies and available power, and adjusting ground temperature to August conditions, I project we can transport a net of 1082 MMSCFD.  At 1010 BTU, this is an equivalent of 1093 MM/D.

Note that the overall unit efficiencies and pipeline roughness did not change significantly from previous models.  What did change is the net available power (as generated by Jon's speed uprate algorithm).  The net result is a net increase in gas horsepower at Stations 1 & 2 by ~4%.

Note that the margin is very close to the 1090 firm volumes.  We will want to monitor operations closely to ensure we maintain unit efficiencies/power output.  We may have to do some unit repairs during tariff months as nominations allow.  This may entail repairs on the weekends.

I also note (as Mr. Schoolcraft pointed out to me) that we are seeing a large fluctuation in the flows at Griffith  (110 MM/d for 30 minutes, off for an hour, cyclical).  From what Darrell has told me, this is due to the way Griffith's flow/pressure control is configured with their dual feed interconnect.  Modifications to the interconnect controls that would smooth these flows would enhance deliverability.  Ideas anyone?  Earl, do you have pipeline/interconnect drawings & EFM/control information on this station for my review?

As part of the control modifications at stations 1 & 2, the remote speed setpoint (from Houston Gas Control) has been deactivated.  Currently Station 2 is being limited by differential pressure control at 175#.  I recommend setting the differential setpoints out of range (200#) and dispatching only on discharge pressure control.  This will ensure we are not limiting power output due to differential pressures.

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Subject:	Storage Injections

The VNG book should currently only have 4 injection tickets.

1. Forward sale to VNG (Paper inventory) - Sitara 699457 (Volumes are hedged-any deviations from the monthly volume need to 
	be communicated to Risk so that Tag can be altered)  Price is at index plus WAC of transport and injection variables.

Applies to following Sitara tickets	
Tickets  represents volumes that ENA borrowed at a zero price and are priced at injection costs. Volumes are hedged.  If the monthly volumes in the sitara tickets deviate from the original volumes, please communicate to Risk so that TAG can be adjusted to reflect the actual monthly injections.
Volumes are currently in at a  ratable injection schedule and can and should be adjusted to reflect the best 'economic' injection schedule. 

These tickets should not be put in as sales to VNG.

2.  Forward sale to Dominion - Sitara 725453
	
3.  TCO CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 723220.  Serves same purpose as CNG injection ticket.  Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to TCO as opposed a CPR ticket to allow for proper scheduling.

4.  Transco WSS CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 594261. Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to Transco as opposed a CPR ticket  to allow for proper scheduling

Sale to VNG and ENA injection tickets should not exceed the maximun quantity allowed to inject in all storages for the summer months.

Clarissa....can some one explain to me what Sitara 730186 represents? It looks like a sale to VNG.  Do this volumes need to be moved to
another ticket? Please advice.

Subject: fuel switching in california

besides electricity, there is an equal and related upcoming 
meltdown on gas in california.  our assessment is that the current 
high prices are largely a result of intrastate constraints that will be 
exacerbated as gas use for power generation increases.  for this 
summer it is possible that there will be generating constraints due 
to inadequate gas delivery capacity.  a more likely outcome is that 
power generators will get the gas they need at the expense of 
storage injection for winter heating load.  this will create supply 
problems and higher residential gas problems next winter.  summer 
prices for industrial gas users will also be higher.

a possible solution is to take advantage of fuel switching.  many of 
the california plants are old oil/gas plants and have the capacity to 
switch fuels.  they are currently limited by environmental limits.  it 
might be in california's broader interests to allow some flexibility on 
switching this summer to ensure power reliability and adequate gas 
storage for the winter.  

reasons for possible interest for enron - better power reliability this 
summer, possible gas/oil trading opportunities, emissions trading 
opportunities?, other?

since oil is much cheaper than the currently high california gas 
prices, this option would also increase the profitability of the plants 
that switch fuels.  it's not clear whether this helps Enron.  one 
option would be to require very clean oil since the market will bear 
significant cost.

there are a few questions related to this: how tight will gas be this 
summer?  what are the likely impacts without switching?  are the 
plants still oil-capable?

let me know if this is something you are interested in discussing.

The vet said Murphy has an ear infection so that's probably why he's been

Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I

it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind 
Ruthie this morning.  All four legs were off the ground - he definitely has 
kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Margaret accumulated.  I think Rita Hartfield would be good in this position 
and would work well with Joan and me.  I would also expect Rita to work 
efficiently on a variety of hot issues--including writing which she is 
proficient at.

Rob, the speech could not have gone better.  It was published as an op-ed

very very useful advice re the structure and content of  Ken Lay's remarks.

Enron calls on Ontario to open power market quickly
April 04, 2001 12:36:00 PM ET
By Scott Anderson 
TORONTO, April 4 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. (ENE), North America's biggest buyer 
and seller of natural gas and electricity, put pressure on the Ontario 
government on Wednesday to deregulate the provincial energy market, Canada's 
biggest, as quickly as possible. 
Ontario has already pushed back its previous deadline of November 2000 by one 
year to sort out its deregulation problems and avoid the problems encountered 
by California in energy deregulation. 
The delays have frustrated potential corporate players. 
""We think the right thing for Ontario is to move ahead with this plan, open 
the markets and get them working,"" Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, said at a 
breakfast speech at the Toronto Board of Trade. 
""Let people start building the new power plants and, of course, providing a 
lot of the types of services we provide elsewhere."" 
Lay warned that the longer the government drags its feet on the issue, the 
more it places itself at risk of scaring off potential investors. 
""The delays continue to create uncertainty and uncertainty tends to 
discourage investment,"" Lay told reporters. ""By discouraging investment, as 
the market keeps growing, it could be that Ontario is going to have a tough 
time keeping up with the needs of the economy."" 
Enron plans to build a $250-million generating plant near the southwestern 
Ontario town of Sarnia, but has delayed the project until Ontario sets a firm 
date for deregulation. 
Lay said Enron is ""committed to Ontario"" even though other companies have 
said they will move to other jurisdictions if the government does not open up 
the market by the fall. 
He said Ontario is far better prepared for deregulation than was California. 
""I think what California shows is that if you're going to do it, you've got 
to do it right. And California did it wrong,"" he told reporters. 
""Increasingly politicians are understanding that. You can't deregulate half 
the market, but not the other half. You can't set up a system that does not 
allow price signals to be sent to consumers and even after prices go up, you 
can't just keep shielding consumers from price signals and get no response."" 
Power demand from California's industries and 32 million residents has 
increased dramatically, but the state has not seen any new generating 
capacity added in about 10 years. The crisis there has been blamed on 
California's own 1996 power deregulation law, which required utilities to buy 
energy on the spot market, where prices have skyrocketed, but maintained caps 
on the rates they could charge consumers. The problem was then compounded by 
California's own surging demand, resulting in the rolling blackouts and 
voluntary power cutbacks of the past months.

Subject: Windows 2000 Migration for the RM-Finance and Administration 
Business Unit

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

Long time no see,
How have you been...must be busy and living a challenging life?
I have been pretty busy too,
to finish a project and write a paper, these days.

Everything looks going OK for my summer internship.
I took necessary steps to work out of campus, and sent
signed contract to Molly a week ago..

Here is what I am expecting to do in the summer.
Please let me know if you have any change in mind.
Actually, I wonder a little bit if DealBench changed its business model...
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked.
I'd like to what's going on in DealBench team...
Raghavan and Ross,
if we talk over phone it will be great!

Dr. Kaminski,
If you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer,
to both you and I, please let me know.
My interest is auction, market design, and simulation.
I am taking a financial engineering class, (mostly on option pricing)
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option.

All of you,
Let's keep in touch until we meet in June!!

Best Regards,

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Subject: Origination Opportunities in Global Markets


Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

It's hysterically funny what people are demanding
of my personal account. People want it updated
immediately and they want the ideas ahead of when
I actually buy (I am doing that). In fact I am letting
our readers front-run me on everything! I reveal what
I am about to recommend and I recommend before I buy.

That's the total antidote to the way Wall Street works.
They want to know how much money I am putting into each
stock. Done. They want the dates that I did it. Harder
because I buy in small increments. They want my stop-loss
limits if I could stop-loss out. I can't do that because
of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it
yesterday or at least when I started this game, and the
market was much higher.

Hey, I am listening! Exclusively on RealMoney.com, you
now have access to my own Personal Portfolio, which is
made up of my picks, shares owned, basis, current value
and gains that he buys and sells on a day-to-day basis.

As of Friday, the portfolio market value is $1,247,537
making me a profit of $124,650.03.

My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't 
quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is 
her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.  

Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to 
hang around close to everyone.  I'll miss him when I'm in FW.

Are you having fun yet!!!!!!

The vet said Murphy has an ear infection so that's probably why he's been 
scratching.  Otherwise, he's in great shape.  31.5 pounds and he also thinks 
Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I 
looked that up, and it's an ugly dog!  He definitely doesn't have that face, 
it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind 
Ruthie this morning.  All four legs were off the ground - he definitely has 
kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only 
push him so far!  I'll try and take some pictures this weekend.  Just thought 
I'd update you on the kids!

Do you need something for lunch?

Dear Silicon Valley Leader:

Please plan to join the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, San Jose Mayor
Ron Gonzales, Santa Clara County Supervisor Jim Beall and other key
community leaders for a ""Santa Clara County Energy Summit II.""

The goal of the Summit is simple - and critical: What IMMEDIATE steps can
each of us individually and collectively take to get California through the
summer months, to minimize rolling blackouts.  With that in mind, we will
focus on QUANTIFIABLE deliverables relative to conservation, load management
during peak periods, generation and state policies.

Special thanks to SVMG Member Company, Synopsys, for offering to host the
Summit, which will take place On Friday, May 4, from 8 a.m. (sharp) until 12
Noon at their Sunnyvale company site, 455 North Mary Avenue, Building 2.

Invitations and registration materials to follow.  If you have any
questions, or require additional information, please call the SVMG offices
at 408/501-7864, or simply respond to this e-mail.

crisis, we found ourselves shaking our heads in disbelief, often saying 
something like:  ""can you believe this? two months ago, we had no idea the PX 
would be melted down!""  We have tremendous resilience in responding to sudden 
legal emergencies, but I am wondering if there is any way we can pro-actively 
plan for what is almost certain to be a further extension of this crisis in 
the west.  I have just come out of a Portland floor meeting where a number of 
presentations were made, one of which was by Tim Heizenrader, our 
fundamentals guru, on the hydro situation in the west.  This is the driest 
year in a hundred years. In a few months we are going to have the equivalent 
of all the nuculear plants in the west shutting down on the same day.   

It is hard to not get kind of hysterical about this legally.  Do we just have 
to sit here like the proverbial deer with this bright light shining in our 
eyes, or is there something we can do to prepare?  If we could have seen the 
first phase of the California crisis, what might we have done differently?  
We can clearly see another phase coming at us, but what do do now, while we 
have all this time, is the big quetion.  I honestly think we should give this 
some priority now, while we may have time to do something about it.   

The reason I think we should engage our better minds on this now is, that I 
tested the traders out on this a time or two (not Tim, who usually thinks a 
lot more strategically than others) and the basic answer they give to the 
question:  what are we going to do if BPA can't deliver us our firm power?""  
is:  ""Oh, we've sold it as firm, if they don't deliver we have liquidated 
damages,  we'll be kept whole.""  This nonchalant answer is, at one level, the 
truth,  but, are we just going to shrug our shoulders and hope the LD's work 
out?   ----cgy",1925,28,0,0,True,2001-03-05 16:58:00,0,e65ef0a70d2e5a47d21c4049fc790b9924bb30894cac4c3674a4b3a6ebd3ef53,30

Subject:	Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,

Jeff:

it was great to see Rebecca and you last night. I was sorry to hear about
your water damage, but thankfully it stayed out of the house. I am
attaching some stuff about the trip to Spain, that you might find useful.
You will find quite a bit of it in your Spain guide. Furthermore, I am
going to start thinking about a diving trip to the Caribbean in November.
You need to take about five days to make it worth while ( you can't dive on
the last day, on account of nitrogen levels in your blood stream). It will
be up to you to get certified in the meantime. The way I would do it (and
actually did) is to go to the Presidente Intercontinental in Cozumel and go
to their dive shop, Scuba Doo, for a three-day course.

I am scheduled to hear from the firm about my partnership election over the
next couple of days. I'll let you know what happens, one way or another. By
the way, I put your name on a list of references, so they might have
called. If they did, many thanks for taking the time and forgive me for not
telling you in advance.

All the best,

Pedro

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

a reiteration of Mid-C. If this causes a problem with your confirm process,

to go to the trouble of adding another, redundant delivery point name in our

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Subject: Softs (Ag) Support

Hi Guys,

I thought I would quickly update you on a few meetings we've had with the ag 
folks here over the past 2 days.  They are extremely interested in weather 
support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date.  A 
summary:

1) They are interested in Cocoa, Coffee and Sugar.  Specifically:
 Brazil:  Londrina, Bauru, Lavras   (All WMOs available in Accuweather)
 Vietnam:  Kentum, Dalat (No data immediately evident)
 Ivory Coast:  Man, Gagnoa (WMOs in Accuwx)
 Indonesia:  Sumatra-Kotubumi, Sulawesi-Dolo (No data immediately evident)

2) They are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature, 
precipitation or wind.  They are also interested in any trend information we 
can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could 
have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on 
ENSO and its impacts on these areas.

3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product 
related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)

4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have 
some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.

Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to 
see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We 
should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of 
international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.  
The problems here would be the models' problems handling tropical weather 
along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.

Let's talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together.

04 May 2001 - Prakash Ambedkar group (RPI) held a  rally  at Ranvi from 1200 
hrs  to 1630 hrs. About  500 people attended the rally of which 200 were  
locals from the vicinity of  the site and remainder a from far off areas like 
Pune, Vidarbha, Mumbai,, Kolhapur etc.
Following persons delivered speeches.
(a)  Prakash Ambedkar Mumbai
(b) Raja Dhale
(c) Shantaram Pandit Nanded
(d) Vasantrao Rane  Pune
(e) Yeshwant Bait  Katalwadi
(f) Dr Dashrath Bhande Vidarbha
(g) Ramchandra Kadam  Ranvi
(h) Baba Bhalekar  Veldur
(j) Atmaram More   Anjanwel 
(k) Prabhakar Jadhav, Sunita Jadhav, Rekha Thakur, Tulsidas Jadhav from 
Chiplun

Highlights of the statements were 
1. To keep fighting until Enron leaves. If  RPI comes to power at grassroot 
level this can be made possible.
2. Judicial probe should be conducted to reveal the fraudulent means used by 
the Enron and  those responsible       for it should be booked.
3 Oppose  re-negotiations with Enron and force  Enron to leave this country.
4 Locals from the area should be provided with jobs in various industries 
coming up in Konkan region.
5 State Government should take over Dabhol project in case the tariff is 
higher than  MSEB tariff.

Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  
I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for 
$145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross 
Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove 
both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

Kevin,

Please, take a look at the link to the website
describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.

The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.

Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 


Any interest?

Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Renee and Brian,

Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery 
turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff 
Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001.

Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires.

Yea I watched some of the game last night too and saw you there.  I was like
""Look it's Dad!!!  Cool!!!!""  Unfortunately there was no one here to tell
that to but it's ok.  I'm glad you had fun.  I ordered flowers last night
for Mom for Mother's Day and for DK for her b-day.  I hope that's ok.  I
didn't know what to get Debbie, but I know I always like flowers so I
thought those would be good.  I'm glad my car is ok.  Please thank Debbie
for me, and I'll thank her as soon as I get the chance.  By the way, I'm not
coming home this weekend because Mom didn't want me to drive home this
weekend and then turn around and come home again on Tuesday (reading days).
David is going to drive up here for the weekend, and we are going to go to
some of the Fiesta festivities around here and the big FiestaFest concert
here on Friday night.  I will be home on Tuesday night though after classes
and will switch back cars then.  (I'll be home Tuesday till Friday morning
to bring a load of stuff home and study.  I also wanted to be there for the
munchkins' b-day party - it is the first one and all.)  Thanks so much for
taking care of my car and letting me borrow the Beemer.  It's been nice
having it!!!  I hope you are having a great day and I'll talk to you
tonight.  I love you!!!
    Love,
    Caron
PS - Thanks for letting the horses go to Nacodoches last weekend.  Rose won
both the costume class and championship so she's qualified for Nationals in
that now, and Ricki won his driving so he's qualified now too.  Rose got 3rd
out of 6 in sidesaddle, but Jennifer said it was her and not Rose (fred said
so too!!).  I'll have to get that qualification in San Antonio.  I just
thought you'd like to know and tell you thanks for giving me some more
classes to ride at Nationals.  Maybe I'll actually win something there this
time around!!!

Stinso, nice to hear from you. Things are going well here. The only
annoyance comes from the INS. I applied for curricular practical
training, and it will take about three months to have the work permit.
Receiving an H-1 takes understably much longer. Other than this, I would
like to know how are things in the research group and EBS.
I will leave for Italy next Monday and will stay there two weeks. I hope
to hear from you before my departure.

With respect to CO#2, we have incorporated your final changes. Please find

I'm looking forward to meeting you on Friday during the information session.  
Just to give you an update, I met with a Texas MBA contact, Charlie Weldon 
(aka Charles V. Weldon), today.  The visit went well and I learned a lot 
about the MBA program at McCombs.  Charlie was uncertain as to what the ""next 
steps"" are in terms of providing feedback to the Admissions Committee. 

It would be great if you could pass on the necessary evaluation forms, 
deadlines, etc. that he will need in order to provide feedback to the 
Admissions Committee.  Charlie's contact information is as follows:

Please feel free to contact me should you need any additional information.  
Again, thank you for your time and I look forward to visiting with you on

Julia,

Thank you for the quick response.  I tried this morning and the
information was
not in the system yet.  However, when I tried this afternoon, I was able
to find
a contact.  I am going to be talking to Charles Weldon (MBA 2000) at one
point
this week.  This is the first interview Charles will be performing and
he was
curious as to what he needed to provide to the Admissions office.  Do I
need to
bring him an evaluation form, etc.?

Also, I plan to come down for the campus tour and information session on
Friday
of this week, April 27, 2001.  I believe that it begins at 1:00 pm.  I
would
love to stop by and visit with you if you have time.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Re:  Application for Connie Nita Lee to the MBA Program at the McCombs
School of
Business

To Whom It May Concern:

I submitted an application through Embark for the MBA Program at the
McCombs
School of Business on Saturday, April 14, 2001.  I have been looking
forward to
scheduling an off-campus interview with a UT Alumnus.  However, I am
having
difficulty signing up for an interview on-line.  I have been entering
the
following information:

birthdate:  19710705
student ID:  334621557

Since the deadline for off-campus interviews is May 1, 2001, you can
probably
understand my concern for getting an interview scheduled.  The people in
the
admissions office were kind enough to check on the status of my
application,
however, it appears that my application has still not down-loaded into
the UT
system.  Can you please inform me of an alternate way to schedule an
off-campus
interview so that I may talk to someone prior to the May 1, 2001
deadline?

Thank you so much for your consideration in the above matter.  I look
forward to
hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Connie Lee

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Well, I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco
to aim at.  I guess Kaley will have to growl at Jack just to stay in
practice.

I should add that Kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something
urgent comes up, I could have to cover for Carlos.  Not likely but you know
how the baby stuff goes.

I think Rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although I don't have any
information to go on.  You mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so I guess
we should expect him to be big.  Maybe one of those tall Labs.  I just hope
his personality stays the same.

I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take
Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend
anyway, so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon
appointment so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility
that I might need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if
I need to go - he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking
him to Moody Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The
long term weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that
week, but you never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do
most of the fishing stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.
If I do go I would like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet
connection I can keep up with a little work and write you, too.

What do you think?

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Vince forwarded your message to me.  

I think it is a relatively easy task to achieve the synchronization with Houston's Exotica Options Library.
Just install Houston's Exotica.xll in London office, which will not take more than one hour. 
We can routinely ship the excutable whenever we update the library for installation in London.


There are good reasons to do this:

1)  We make changes to Exotica frequently. In this sense, it is very hard to keep 
ONE version across the company if offices outside Houston want to maintain their own
version.

2)  It is not necessary and cost effective to maintain different versions. As matter of fact, it is harmful
to have different versions. At the end of the day, it is Enron's P/L, different versions of Exotica would
produce a small difference in per unit basis, however, this difference could  be amplified to 
a large discrepency due to the large trade volumes. 

3) The London research plans to rewrite Exotica in C++. In our view, Exotica's routine is
small and self-contained, the objective programming will not add much value to it. While
it is nice to have a C++ version, but we think it should be assigned a low priority. We 
are not moving to C++ any time soon in Houston. 


Let me know if this answers your question. My phone number is 713-853-6388.

Bjorn,

I don't think the scope of the project is really that big. When we looked
into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue. 

To me, it's  really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be
an equivalent of a Desert Storm operation.

Hi Bjorn,

some time ago we, you, Stinson and I, had a meeting in Houston regarding having the same versions for Houston and London.

We agreed that you would talk to Ted Murphy to get his support for this project. I know that Ted did not come to Houston at the time he planned and therefore you were not able to talk to him (you were on holidays when he came to Houston).

This project is really big (several man month work) and we cannot do this without Ted's support. You know that requests from RAC are always taken very seriously.

Please, could you talk to Ted to get his support.

Good Afternoon,

I have been unable to sucessfully test the Preschedule workspace, here are the problems I have run up against:

In the special Terminal server that Will sent me,  I was unable to copy from Excel and paste into the app

In the local system, I was able to copy from Excel and Paste into the app, but it would not allow me to save any data.  The app saved itself as a file, but none of my data were preserved in it. Here is the saved app file that was created.

 << File: MAY_O2_PV.psc >> 

Both locally and in Terminal server, I was unable to close the app.  I had to use the task manager and end task to get me out of the Preschedule workspace viewer.  I did get numerous dialog boxes with various errors, but did not log them all. I can do that if you wish.

I have a set of data re-designed to match the columns of the app, here is the data for May 2.  This will be the approximate size of the sheet if monthly deals are required to be included.

 << File: may2pvhlhdata.xls >> 
Please let me know what I can do to begin testing again,  I am very anxious to get started.

Subject: St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO]


St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT].  

On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that 
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline 
spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's 
gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the 
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 
26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie 
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract 
together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt 
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's 
processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there 
is not much negotiating that will be done.

Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in 
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re 
Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been 
such an issue.

Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%, 
producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12% 
shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of 
processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract 
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO.

St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if 
100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as 
VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas.  

St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should 
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA 
for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you 
put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in 
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me 
know ASAP.

George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR.

Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT?

Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's 
cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the 
time period that processing is mandatory.  

Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about 
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified 
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas?

Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with 
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does 
go into effect on Monday.

Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

Max,

I would find it doubtful that that the flight crew would test the aircraft in such a fashion, during a scheduled flight with pax aboard. Anytime there is a problem with flight control that is VERY serious. I'm glad they seemed to have handled the situation. It probably was not a VOR problem but more likely a flight control problem i.e. control surfaces, rudder, ailerons. The VOR fail message could have been due to a power down of the avionics consistent with a post emergency-landing procedure.

I have a commercial pilot certificate and have done some charter work. In addition I've flown a 757 in the simulator at United and know how many back ups those things have. They are very redundant.

I'm really glad everything turned out okay.

All the best,
Andy

Andy:

I was actually the person to whom this happened.  I was on an AeroMexico flight yesterday from Mexico City to Monterrey.  Within minutes after leaving Mexico City the plane started to hump up and down and then started fishtailing.  It is unclear whether this was something the pilot was doing to test the plane or not.  We quickly circled back to Mexico City, but came in very, very low on our approach (and seemed to be losing speed).

In any event, as I was exiting the plane, I looked into the cockpit and saw the message ""VOR2  FAIL"" on the center display.  Being an admitted greenhorn at these things, I didn't know what else to look for or where to look for it, so there may have been something I overlooked.

The crew was very short on details, but they appeared very rattled by all of this.  One of the flight attendants told a fellow passenger who was complaining about being late that he should simply be thankful he was still alive.  [Probably not what they teach in flight attendant school as the optimal response, but . . . . . .]

In any event, I appreciate the info below and would appreciate any additional info this message may lead you to.  I'd love to know whether or not the adrenaline surge was warranted.

Subject:	RE: On a plane

a VOR is the standard instrument for navigating an aircraft under an IFR flight plan. It is the receiver that allows the plane to be flown on bearings from ground stations. If it were to fail there would be loads of backups, although if you are on a scheduled flight their operations manual would dictate that the flight be terminated as soon as practicable in the event any primary component, such as this were to fail. Where were you that you were able to monitor the performance of this instrument ? The flight deck ?

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

Dear Ms. St. Clair,

In my discussions with Rhonda L Denton, I understand that certain Enron
transactions have been confirmed
as Merrill Lynch Transactions. My understanding of the facts are that
Merrill Lynch has not entered into any
Financial Swaps with Enron North America since  3/16/2001.  Any Financial
transactions after March 16, 2001
should be confirmed as Allegheny Energy as governed by the ISDA Master
Agreement signed on March 16, 2001.

I have confirmed these facts with Ms. Lucy Dorr of ML Client Services;
similarly, Lucy has discussed this matter with
Locke Mc Murray, Counsel to ML Commodities.

The deals in the attached list show ML as the counterparty on Financially
Settled Power Swaps which is incorrect.
Merrill Lynch has entered into Physical Settlement Power transactions which
should be confirmed with ML for
billing purposes.

Allegheny Energy would be happy to supply a letter to Enron to confirm these
facts.
Please feel free to contact me should you need further help in resolving
this matter.


Best Regards,

(See attached file: merrillissue.xls)
Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the
transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are
Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and
were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit.

Carl and Leonardo were not included on this email. I think it is important to keep them involved with the marketing teams (as they were before). In particular, they provide valuable knowledge about how EnronOnline actually works to people who may not be so familiar with these details.

To address this, could you re-send the email with Carl and Leonardo assigned to specific teams? An alternative would be to send an amendment identifying that they will work with all the teams, but I'm keen to ensure they don't feel like some kind of 2nd-class support. They have been instrumental in preparing presentations, materials, company lists, research and contract precedents and they would very much like to continue to play an important role in the marketing and execution and not just to be seen as some kind of administrative support.

Thoughts?

Dave

I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established

All,

Dale Neuner and Ross Mesquita referred me to you all.  I work with Global Strategic Sourcing and am looking to implement an ""online marketplace"" idea into Enron Online.  This would involve vendors and suppliers providing bids in a structured format - kind of like a reverse auction E-Bay.  Vendors would be able to see their competitors bids online, but not their names.  Any registered vendor would be able to update their numbers online, ""real time"".

First, we would like to know if anything like this is being done at Enron.  
Next, is it technologically possible to bring this concept into Enron Online?

Please advise.  We would like to do a test pilot as soon as possible with Crane Rentals.  Please give me a call so we can discuss this possibility,

Marty - the latest -

2 Direct Access bills (Bowen, Kelly) are still on the table.  Have not 
changed much since my earlier e-mail to you, except that Bowen bill now 
includes a fee to the alternate provider when a customer is ""involuntarily 
returned"" to the utility.  Language is attached.

 - SB 27xx - mockup.doc

Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving 
SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep).  Speaker Hertzberg and 
Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support 
agreements the parties reach.   Jeff tells me this morning they are getting 
close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are 
still major stumbling blocks,  mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs 
and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them.  The bond guys see 
direct access as possible undermining the bonds.  If or once agreement is 
reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that 
would apply California-wide.

The general structure in the SCE discussion is this -
By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility 
for a long (5 yrs+) period.  Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 
month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under 
utility default.   20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access.  
Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access.   
Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely 
require large customers (20 kw+)  to pay a disproportionate share of the 
costs.

This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid.   
Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff 
Dasovich? 

Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on 
Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the 
AB1x.  The expectation is that the vote will be delayed.  Best information 
says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a 
new
scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
and PJM.
CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from 
and
to PJM neighbors.

PJM will offer several two-hour ""virtual"" workshops to introduce the new 
system.
Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 
5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
internet with audio teleconference.

A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a 
registration
form for the program are available on the PJM web site at

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon",2341,88,0,0,True,2001-04-12 15:35:00,0,9348bf2f0a699a3b1c61f1de47bf7d86634a362caed283648023915c016a3cf4,99

I had an hour-long conversation yesterday with a guy from Tyler named
Jorge Uresti.  He proposed a very interesting idea, and I'd love to get
your feedback on it.

Jorge has worked on in media, advertising, etc. for political campaigns
since 1994.  He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs,
billboards) for various levels of campaigns.  I think he sees the vast
marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and
he wants to be involved.  He threw out the idea of creating a section of
GOPUSA called GOPUSA MediaWorks.  This division would be under the
GOPUSA umbrella and handle all media operations for conservative
business, candidates, and elected officials.  The scope would be web
design, media, advertising, and on and on.

I'm very excited about this because it taps into the whole top-level
vision I have for the company which is to help get the conservative
message out.  Whether we are doing it ourselves (through our news,
information, and commentary) or providing the tools for others to do it,
we can become THE source for conservative activists to get or deliver
their message.

So, assuming this is a good idea (and if it's totally lame, please tell
me), what would be the best way of structuring it?  Simple
sub-contracting?  Creating a separate division?  My instincts tell me
that subcontracting would be easiest right now.  Plus, if the
relationship turned out to be unworkable, then we simply stop doing
business with them.

How would be go about pricing all of this?  What type of percentage
would be fair?  Obviously, we are talking about work that the current
GOPUSA is unable to perform because I don't have the time (for web
design stuff) or the experience (in the media stuff).  On the flip side,
there is no doubt that we could deliver clients these guys that they
would have never landed on their own.  If some folks in their region
might not know them, but they might be familiar with GOPUSA.

Anyway, I'm just passing along some thoughts.  Perhaps Chris might have
some comments as well.

Take care,

Bobby
