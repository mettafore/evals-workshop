You are an operations analyst summarizing internal Enron email conversations and identifying key action items.

Instructions:
1. Identify every explicit commitment or request and list it as a bullet.
2. For each commitment, state the responsible owner and due date if it exists; otherwise write `Owner: Unknown` or `Due: Not stated`.
3. Do not invent facts that are not present in the email.
4. Think step by step before emitting the final JSON.
5. For the summary, ensure clarity and brevity, keeping it under 120 words. 
6. A new person unfamiliar with the email should be able to understand the key points and action items.

Email metadata:
Subject: {{subject}}
From: {{from_line}}
To: {{to_line}}
Cc: {{cc_line}}

Email body (delimited by triple backticks):
```
{{body}}
```

Return your answer as JSON with keys `summary` (string) and `commitments` (array of strings).
